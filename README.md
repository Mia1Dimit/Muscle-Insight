# Muscle Insight

Welcome to **Muscle Insight**‚Äîa project for advanced, real-time monitoring and analysis of muscle fatigue using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals.

## üöÄ What is Muscle Insight?
Muscle Insight aims to bring deeper understanding and practical monitoring of muscle fatigue to sports, rehabilitation, and daily activity contexts. By leveraging wireless sEMG sensors and state-of-the-art signal analysis, we extract meaningful fatigue metrics and enable real-time feedback.

## üåü Key Features

- **sEMG Signal Processing:** Robust algorithms for denoising and feature extraction from sEMG data.
- **Fatigue Metrics:** Multiple time and frequency domain metrics (e.g., mnf_arv_ratio, ima_diff) with research-backed validation.
- **Windowing Strategy:** Flexible window size and overlap for optimal feature tracking (best: 800 samples, 75‚Äì87.5% overlap).
- **Calibration & Baseline Analysis:** Per-user calibration with idle and active state comparisons for reliable monitoring.
- **Fatigue Regression Models:** Machine learning regression for continuous fatigue estimation.
- **BLE Integration:** Arduino Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication for wireless, real-time data transfer.
- **Open Documentation:** Extensive notes, results, and research references for transparency and reproducibility.

## üìà Project Progress

We‚Äôve completed all major design, signal processing, analysis, and implementation steps‚Äîincluding algorithm development, BLE integration, and fatigue regression modeling. For a detailed breakdown, see the task checklist below.
