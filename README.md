# Daily Progress Log - 16/12

## Tasks

### 1. Koubias Document
- [ ] Completed document draft
- [ ] Anamoni John's review

### 2. MNF/ARV Ratio Analysis Method

#### Key Requirements
- MNF/ARV ratio calculation
- Fatigue exists once the ratio reaches a specific baseline, which is defined as the inverse value of the MNF/ARV
- the initial values of the MNF and ARV are taken as the reference values for the baseline to eliminate individual differences. 
- The correlation coefficient between MNF and ARV is taken as an index of fatigue
- The conversion of the correlation coefficient from positive to negative is regarded as a sign of muscle fatigue.

## Action Items
- [ ] Finalize document to be sent to Koubias
- [ ] Implement rest steps for MNF/ARV ratio calculation
