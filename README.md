# Muscle Insight Project Definition


The "Muscle Insight" project is dedicated to advancing the understanding and monitoring of muscle fatigue by analyzing surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. By collecting extensive sEMG data from various individuals performing a standardized leg extension exercise, the project focuses on extracting some correlation out of meaningful metrics and muscle fatigue. This data-driven approach aims to uncover patterns and relationships in muscle activity, paving the way for innovative applications in health, sports science, and rehabilitation.
